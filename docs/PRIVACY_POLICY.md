# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: 2026-02-05_

This Privacy Policy describes how **Vietnamese Tone Trainer** ("we," "our," or "us") handles data when you use the mobile application (the "App").

## 1) Data we process

### Microphone / audio input
The App requests microphone access (`android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO`) only to provide speech and pronunciation training features.

- Audio is processed locally on your device.
- We do not upload audio recordings to our servers.
- We do not sell audio data.

### Technical data
The App does not intentionally collect personal identifiers. Android/Google Play systems may process limited technical data (for example, crash diagnostics) under their own privacy terms.

## 2) Why we process data
We process microphone input only to provide core functionality: tone and pronunciation analysis, training feedback, and related learning features.

## 3) Data sharing
We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties for advertising.

## 4) Data retention
We do not store microphone recordings on our servers. Audio is processed in memory during use and then discarded.

## 5) Children
The App is not specifically directed to children under 13 unless explicitly stated in the store listing. If we learn that personal data from a child was provided to us in error, we will delete it where applicable.

## 6) Your choices
- You can deny or revoke microphone permission in Android settings at any time.
- If microphone permission is disabled, voice-related features may not work.

## 7) Security
We apply reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data processed by the App. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## 8) Changes to this Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The latest version will always be available at the same URL, and the "Last updated" date will be revised.

## 9) Contact
For privacy questions, use the developer contact shown on the Google Play store listing for this App.
